# Neha_Singh_Analyzing-Crop-Production-Trends-in-Indian-States
This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project on Crop Production Trends. It covers everything from data cleaning, SQL operations, and exploratory data analysis, to interactive dashboards and machine learning modelling.

## Project Structure
SECTION A: Python & Data Cleaning

- Importing and understanding the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Removing inconsistencies and duplicates
- Feature formatting and standardization
- Initial descriptive checks
- Creation of clean, analysis-ready datasets

SECTION B: SQL Operations

- Importing cleaned data into SQL
- Running queries for data aggregation
- Filtering crop-wise and state-wise trends
- Applying GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN operations
- Generating production summaries using SQL logic

SECTION C: EDA & Descriptive Statistics

- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Trend analysis for crop production over the years
- State-level and region-level comparisons
- Measures of central tendency & variability
- Outlier detection
- Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Key insights and patterns extracted

SECTION D: Tableau Dashboard

- Interactive dashboard showing crop production trends
- Year-wise, crop-wise, and state-wise filters
- KPI indicators for total production
- Comparative charts and drill-down analytics
- User-friendly visual storytelling

SECTION E:  Machine Learning

- Feature selection & encoding
- Train-test split
- Predictive modelling (Regression / Classification depending on dataset)
- Model performance evaluation (R², RMSE, Accuracy, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Final model insights and recommendations

# Technologies & Tools Used
